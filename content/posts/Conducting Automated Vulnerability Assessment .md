# Introduction

Vulnerability Assessments are an important part of Cybersecurity and they allow organizations to identify weaknesses in their systems before attacks can exploit them. We do not always have time to conduct manual Vulnerability Assessments hence there’s where Automated Tools come into play. In this guide we’ll look into some of the popular Vulnerability Assessments Tools. 

## What is Vulnerability Assessment

A vulnerability assessment goes beyond just scanning for issues—it also uncovers security misconfigurations and policy noncompliance that could put an organization at risk. The process provides security teams with valuable insights into potential threats, allowing them to prioritize and remediate vulnerabilities effectively.

The assessment typically follows these five key steps:

1. **Identifying Vulnerabilities** – Scanning and mapping out all security weaknesses in the IT environment.
2. **Analyzing Vulnerabilities** – Investigating the source, impact, and root cause of detected vulnerabilities.
3. **Assessing Risk Levels** – Prioritizing vulnerabilities based on severity to focus on critical threats first.
4. **Remediating Security Gaps** – Applying patches, fixing misconfigurations, or implementing security measures to mitigate risks.
5. **Reporting and Documentation** – Creating detailed reports to track vulnerabilities, fixes, and security improvements.

## Importance of Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Automated vulnerability scanning is a crucial component of modern cybersecurity, helping organizations identify security weaknesses efficiently and consistently. Unlike manual assessments, automated scanning tools can quickly analyze large IT infrastructures, detecting vulnerabilities in networks, applications, and systems without requiring extensive human effort.

Some of the advantages of Automated Vulnerability Scanning are:

1. **Efficiency and Speed:** Automated Tools can scan thousands of assets in minutes, which reduces the time taken to find vulnerabilities. 
2. **Consistent Regular Scanning:** Since these tools can be set up to be fully automated and do not require much supervision this allows organizations to be able to set them up for regular scanning at regular intervals. 
3. **Comprehensive Coverage:** These tools usually a wide range of vulnerabilities which includes outdated software, misconfigurations and weak authentication mechanisms. 
4. **Risk Prioritization:** Almost all of these tools classify vulnerabilities according to their severity which allows for prioritization of more critical vulnerabilities. 

## Overview of Tools Covered: Rapidscan, Nikto, Nessus, OWASP ZAP, Nmap

Automated vulnerability scanning relies on various tools, each designed to assess different aspects of security. Below is an overview of five widely used tools in vulnerability assessment:

### 1. **Rapidscan**

Rapidscan is an automated vulnerability scanner that combines multiple security tools into a single script, making it a convenient solution for quick vulnerability assessments. It scans web applications for issues like outdated software, misconfigurations, and common exploits.

- **Key Features:**
    - Aggregates results from multiple scanning tools.
    - Fast and efficient scanning with minimal user interaction.
    - Detects common web vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and XSS.

### 2. **Nikto**

Nikto is a web server scanner designed to identify security vulnerabilities in web applications. It checks for outdated software, insecure configurations, and potentially dangerous files.

- **Key Features:**
    - Scans for over 6,700 known vulnerabilities.
    - Detects misconfigurations, default credentials, and outdated software.
    - Supports SSL scanning and multiple web servers.

### 3. **Nessus**

Nessus, developed by Tenable, is one of the most widely used vulnerability scanners for network and system security assessments. It identifies vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and compliance issues.

- **Key Features:**
    - Detects over 75,000 vulnerabilities across different platforms.
    - Provides detailed risk assessments with exploitability ratings.
    - Supports compliance scanning for regulations like PCI-DSS and CIS benchmarks.

### 4. **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**

OWASP ZAP is an open-source tool designed for finding security vulnerabilities in web applications. It is widely used for penetration testing and automated scanning of web applications.

- **Key Features:**
    - Identifies SQL injection, XSS, and other common web vulnerabilities.
    - Provides both automated scanning and manual testing features.
    - Supports integration with CI/CD pipelines for continuous security testing.

### 5. **Nmap (Network Mapper)**

Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool that helps identify open ports, services, and vulnerabilities in network infrastructure. It is often used for network discovery and security audits.

- **Key Features:**
    - Performs port scanning, service detection, and OS fingerprinting.
    - Identifies potential vulnerabilities in network devices.
    - Supports script-based scanning (Nmap Scripting Engine - NSE) for deeper analysis.

# Installing and Configuring Tools

## Pre-requisites

The prerequisite for these tools is Kali Linux. You just have to install the Kali Version according to your needs, i.e., Installer Images or VM Images. You can get them from Kali Linux’s website. We’re using Kali because it comes with most tools pre-installed which is helpful for tools like Rapidscan, which work on existing tools. Not to mention Nmap and Nikto are also installed by default on Kali so it makes our job easier. 

## Rapidscan

The first tool we are going to install is Rapidscan. Rapidscan works on top of existing tools like Nikto, Golismero etc. So the best approach is to install it in Kali Linux since most of the tools used by rapidscan come pre-installed on it. 

Clone the [Rapidscan’s](https://github.com/skavngr/rapidscan) repository using `git clone` and then cd into it. 

The official repo states that the command to install packages and everything is:

```bash
python3 -m pip install .             
error: externally-managed-environment

× This environment is externally managed
╰─> To install Python packages system-wide, try apt install
    python3-xyz, where xyz is the package you are trying to
    install.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.
    Then use path/to/venv/bin/python and path/to/venv/bin/pip. Make
    sure you have python3-full installed.
    
    If you wish to install a non-Debian packaged Python application,
    it may be easiest to use pipx install xyz, which will manage a
    virtual environment for you. Make sure you have pipx installed.
    
    See /usr/share/doc/python3.12/README.venv for more information.

note: If you believe this is a mistake, please contact your Python installation or OS distribution provider. You can override this, at the risk of breaking your Python installation or OS, by passing --break-system-packages.
hint: See PEP 668 for the detailed specification.

```

As you can see it throws the above error. There are 2 ways to resolve this. The easiest being just adding `--break-system-packages` to the above command. But the preferred and best solution is creating a venv first. We can do that in the following way:

```bash
(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/rapidscan]
└─$ python3 -m venv myenv
                                                                                                                                                             
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/rapidscan]
└─$ source myenv/bin/activate
                                                                                                                                                             
┌──(myenv)─(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/rapidscan]
└─$ python3 -m pip install .

```

Now Rapidscan is installed properly. To test whether it works properly we will use the following command:

```bash
──(myenv)─(kali㉿kali)-[~/Tools/rapidscan]
└─$ python3 rapidscan.py

                                / ( (//)/(/__)( (//)                                                                                                         
                                     /                                                                                                                       
                     (The Multi-Tool Web Vulnerability Scanner)

```

As we can see it’s working properly.

Now there’s some other tools that we might have to install since Kali might not have those tools pre-installed. When we run Rapidscan initially we will see the following output 

```bash
     __         __
                                 /__)_   ●_/(  _ _
                                / ( (//)/(/__)( (//)
                                     /
                     (The Multi-Tool Web Vulnerability Scanner)

                     Check out our new software, NetBot for simulating DDoS attacks - https://github.com/skavngr/netbot
    

[ Checking Available Security Scanning Tools Phase... Initiated. ]
        Some of these tools ['dnswalk', 'uniscan', 'xsser', 'golismero'] are unavailable or will be skipped. RapidScan will still perform the rest of the tests. Install these tools to fully utilize the functionality of RapidScan.
[ Checking Available Security Scanning Tools Phase... Completed. ]

```

As we can see in the above output we can see the tools that are unavailable. The scan can still be continued even if those tools are not installed but it is recommended to install them using their relevant documentation. 

## Nessus

Now we will install Nessus. The first step in doing that is to go  [Nessus’s website](https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus) . There we will choose the platform as *Linux-Debian-amd64.* Download the file but before doing that we need to first install a dependency: 

```bash
sudo apt-get update #to update package list

zypper install -y hostname
```

Once it’s done successfully we will install Nessus using:

```bash
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]

 - You can start Nessus Scanner by typing /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service
 - Then go to https://kali:8834/ to configure your scanner

 
```

Note down your Nessus running URL and then run the following commands to start the Nessus service and check the status of it

```bash
──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ /bin/systemctl start nessusd.service

```

As we can see it’s running actively and now we will go to the URL that we noted earlier to access the Nessus Dashboard. We might get a security risk warning but go to advanced and access the page anyway. 

We will now see this page
![Nessus Welcome Screen](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image.png)


Nessus Welcome Screen

We will click on continue and then select the **Register for Nessus Essentials** option. Just enter your information on the following page and then continue.  Copy the Activation Code somewhere and then you’ll see the following page:

![Nessus User Account Screen](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%201.png)

Nessus User Account Screen

Create a user account and then click on submit. Make sure you remember the password since you’ll use it later. 

Nessus will now start downloading and installing the plugins. This will take some time. and once it is done the dashboard will load. However some plugins will still be compiling and you’ve got to wait some more. Once you see the following screen then the plugins are done compiling

![Nessus Dashboard Welcome](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%202.png)

## OWASP ZAP

We will now look at how to install ZAP. First we will go to the [ZAP Download](https://www.zaproxy.org/download/) Page. We will download the Linux Installer package. 

Once it’s done downloading we will run the following commands to run the installer:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ chmod +x ZAP_2_16_0_unix.sh 
                                                                                                                                                             
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ sudo ./ZAP_2_16_0_unix.sh  
Starting Installer ...
                     
```

Follow the on-screen instructions after the installer launches, to install ZAP. 

# Running Vulnerability Scans

## Rapidscan

### Command-Line Usage

Before running Rapidscan we need to activate the virtual environment we created during installation earlier. The command is `source myenv/bin/activate` . Now we will look at the command line usage and what commands can be run: 

- `python3 rapidscan.py example.com` This will initiate Rapidscan against the given website.
- `python3 rapidscan.py [example.com](http://example.com/) --skip dmitry --skip theHarvester` This will skip dmitry and Harvester scans against the website.
- `python3 rapidscan.py [example.com](http://example.com/) --nospinner` Disables the idle loader/spinner
- `python3 [rapidscan.py](http://rapidscan.py) —update` This will update the scanner to the lastest version available
- `python3 [rapidscan.py](http://rapidscan.py) --help` Displays the help menu

Other than this we also have `Ctrl+C` to skip the current test and `Ctrl+Z` to end the scan. 

We also need to know the color codes and what they represent which can be seen in the below picture: 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%203.png)

This is pretty much self explanatory. 

### Interpreting Scan Results

Now we will run a scan to show how the output works. I’ll be using Google Gruyere  which is a buggy web application hosted by google. To start the scan we will run the command:

`python3 [rapidscan.py](http://rapidscan.py) *website*` 

Initiating the scan we see the following output immediately:

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%204.png)

There are few things to note here. Firstly we detected a vulnerability which ranks High. We can see the definition and remediation for it. We can also look at the detail by looking up the Vulnerability. 

Secondly, since some tools aren’t available their corresponding tests will not be performed. Also the color coding next to the test and the time shows the estimated time needed for the test to run. Since there are 80 tests in total we will not cover each of them since it would make the guide too long. 

## Nikto

### Command-Line Usage

We will now look at Nikto. If it’s installed properly we will run `nikto -Version` and if it displays the version it means Nikto is installed and working properly. We can run `nikto -Help` to see the help menu but running an incorrect command also displays it. The help menu is as follows:

```bash

```

As you can see there’s a lot of options and setting we can configure. We will look in detail into the tool at a later point of time but for now the default scan should be good enough. We only need to look at the following command to run the scan using the default parameters

`nikto -h *website*`

```

We have skipped most of the output as this is a very vulnerable web application and as a result will have a lot of vulnerabilities present. I just am showing this output so you note down the structure of the Nikto output. 

## Nessus

### Creating and Running a Scan

We looked at how to access the Nessus Dashboard in the [Nessus](https://www.notion.so/Nessus-18c000fc4bee8086849dc63649752dea?pvs=21) Installation Section. Now once we’ve accessed the Dashboard we will be greeted by the following screen:

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%205.png)

We will click on New Scan or Create a New Scan. 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%206.png)

As we can see there are quite a lot of scan options present. We are interested in Web Application Tests since we’re testing a website hence we’ll select that. 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%207.png)

We can enter one target or multiple or even a file for targets. Since we only have one target we’ll be looking at that. We will leave the rest of the options on default but there’s quite some settings that we can look at.

We can schedule the scan or enter an email so that it can email us the scan results. 

![image.png]@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4(image%208.png)

We can change the scan type if needed but we’ll keep it at quick for the current scan. Once we’re done we will click on save. As soon as we do that we’ll see the following screen

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%209.png)

To initiate the scan we will click on the play button. 

### Analyzing Scan Reports

We can click on the running scan to see what’s going on. 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2010.png)

In the Hosts section we can see the hosts that were scanned, the number of vulnerabilities identified and their respective severity. Clicking on the Vulnerabilities section we can see the following:

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2011.png)

The Medium Vulnerability denotes the corresponding CVSS Rating. The Mixed section contains multiple different vulnerabilities. That and the other sections can be further clicked to see further information and detail on them. 

Clicking on the first section yields the following result

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2012.png)

This shows us the the detail on the vulnerability, references and the pages effected by it. 

Now to look at how to export a report. We need to make sure the scan has completed and then go to the scan options  on the following page 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2013.png)

We will click on the Report Option. That will open the following page:

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2014.png)

We will click on Generate Report to generate the report. I have selected the PDF option as it’s the easiest. We can then go through the report or use it in our vulnerability assessments. 

## OWASP ZAP

### Automated Scanning with ZAP

When we open ZAP we will be greeted by the following page:

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2015.png)

We will select the Automated Scan Option and then on the following page

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2016.png)

we will enter the URL and select the default options. Make sure the browser you have selected is installed and so on. 

<aside>
💡

Also the browser will automatically open and close so do not panic. This is the ZAP Spider running. 

</aside>

We will see the following menu options below which will populate with results once the scan is initiated: 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2017.png)

As we can see in the alerts section we can see the alerts and their corresponding details that can be seen by clicking on them. 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2018.png)

Hence here we can see the details on a vulnerability/alert. 

This shows the AJAX Spider results and the URLs crawled. Out-of-Scope URLs will not be scanned and the scanned ones are denoted using a green icon.

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2019.png)

As you can see it shows a detail for each path. 

We can now see the following Active Scan output:

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2020.png)

This shows the URLs crawled and the response code for them. This takes more time than the usual scan. 

To generate a report for the above scan results we will select the Generate Report option

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2021.png)

We can further modify the options we want to see in the report

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2022.png)

### Manual Testing with ZAP (Brief Overview)

We can also perform manual testing with ZAP in case we want more control over the scan and there are some login fields we want to fill manually. Select the Manual Testing option from the Quick-Start option 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2023.png)

We need to make sure the Enable HUD option is selected.

After the browser is launched we are greeted by the following screen: 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2024.png)

It’s recommended to take the HUD tutorial since it’ll give you overview on what the HUD is. 

We will now select the top most option on the left i.e the one that says out. It will ask for confirmation *Add current Domain to Scope?* Select yes and proceed. 

The second option named Break is used to capture requests. When it’s enabled each subsequent request will need to be manually approved to be sent to the web server.  However, we will not test it out in this tutorial since it’s quite extensive. 

The third option named Show/Enable is used to detect hidden parameters. When clicked it will show any hidden parameters that are not visible. Let’s look at the following example. We will go to the login field which by default shows this: 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2025.png)

Now selecting the Show/Enable button we can see the hidden fields. 

![image.png](@/assets/blog/blog4/blog4image%2026.png)

In the above image another things that need to be noted are the flags. The flags on the left side denote vulnerabilities on the current page and on the right side denote the total vulnerabilities. We can also start the Active Scan using the 4th button the right. The 5th option stands for Attack Mode. This will automatically test each page we open for vulnerabilities and can be opened. 

Another option is the plus icon which can be used to add further plugins and such. This concludes the ZAP Section.

SEE THE MAN PAGE (https://nmap.org/book/man.html) FOR MORE OPTIONS AND EXAMPLE
```

We will only look at a few optionssince going through all of them would take too much time. We will look at the following scan parameters:

1. Default Scan: The default Nmap scan (`nmap <target>`) performs a **TCP SYN scan** (if run as root) or a **TCP connect scan** (if run as a regular user) on the **1,000 most common ports**. It checks if the target host is up using ICMP ping, identifies open ports, and attempts to detect the service and version running on those ports. The results are displayed in a concise format, showing open ports, their state, and associated services. This scan is quick and efficient for basic reconnaissance. 
2. `-v:` This shows the verbose output for the scan as the scan is progressing. Without this enabled the scan results are shown after it’s completion. 
3. `-O:` This performs OS detection on the scanned hosts/IPs. 
4. `-p:` This scans particular ports. `-p22` will scan port 22 only. `-p5-4000` will scan ports 4 to 4000. 
5. `-sV` Performs version detection on open ports. 

### Interpreting Nmap Output

We will now look at different scan outputs to see the difference in them:

```bash
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ nmap google-gruyere.appspot.com
Starting Nmap 7.94SVN ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-02-17 03:05 EST

```

This was the default nmap scan and it shows the following output. It shows that the host is up and the corresponding latency for that. Also shows the addresses for it and the DNS record. Also shows the ports that are open and number of filtered ports. Now we will try with OS Detection. 

```bash

```

It shows the following output. We can see the additional OS Lines corresponding to the Operating Systems that may be running on the server. Now we will add -sV and -v and see the results:

```bash

```

As we can see in the above output we saw verbose output which shows details of the scan. We might not see the service versions since there’s not any other ports option and hence no services but this is the general idea.

## When to Use Which Tool

Each of these vulnerability assessment tools has its strengths and is suited for different aspects of security testing. Here's a breakdown of when to use each:

1. **Nmap** – **Reconnaissance & Port Scanning**
    
    Nmap is best for mapping out a target's attack surface. It helps identify open ports, services, and potential vulnerabilities before diving into deeper scans. Use it in the early phases of an assessment to gather intelligence on the target system.
    
2. **RapidScan** – **Quick, Multi-Tool Scanning**
    
    If you're short on time and need a broad scan without running multiple tools separately, RapidScan is a good choice. It combines results from several security scanners, giving a quick overview of vulnerabilities without deep analysis.
    
3. **Nikto** – **Web Server & Application Scanning**

- **For in-depth web app testing:** OWASP ZAP
- **For full-scale vulnerability assessment:** Nessus

# Best Practices

## Handling False Positives

When conducting automated vulnerability assessments, following best practices ensures accurate results and reduces unnecessary noise. One of the key challenges in this process is handling false positives.

False positives occur when a tool flags a vulnerability that doesn’t actually exist or isn't exploitable. Here’s how to manage them effectively:

1. **Verify Findings Manually** – Automated tools can sometimes misinterpret responses. Always validate critical findings by manually testing them using different methods or tools.
2. **Cross-Check with Multiple Tools** – No single tool is perfect. If a vulnerability is flagged, check if other scanners report the same issue. For example, if Nessus reports a web vulnerability, validate it with OWASP ZAP or Nikto.
3. **Understand the Tool's Limitations** – Some tools rely on banner grabbing or outdated vulnerability databases, leading to inaccurate results. Familiarize yourself with how each tool detects vulnerabilities.
4. **Use Context Awareness** – A flagged issue might be a vulnerability in one environment but not in another. Assess the actual risk based on system configurations, network exposure, and the presence of security controls.
5. **Regularly Update Tools and Databases** – Many false positives stem from outdated vulnerability signatures. Keeping your scanners updated ensures more accurate results.
6. **Leverage Manual Testing and Exploitation Frameworks** – If a high-risk vulnerability is detected, try verifying it with penetration testing tools like Metasploit to confirm exploitability.

## Frequency of Scans

Determining the optimal frequency of vulnerability scans is essential for maintaining robust security. The appropriate schedule depends on your organization's risk tolerance, compliance requirements, and IT infrastructure. Here are key guidelines for scheduling scans:

1. **Regularly Scheduled Scans** – Run automated vulnerability scans at least **monthly** to catch new security risks and misconfigurations early.
2. **After System or Application Updates** – Scan after any system, web application, or network configuration changes to verify that updates haven't introduced vulnerabilities.
3. **Following a Security Incident** – Conduct a comprehensive vulnerability scan after any breach or security incident to identify weaknesses that may have enabled the attack.
4. **Compliance-Driven Scans** – Finance, healthcare, and other regulated industries must perform vulnerability assessments at specific intervals (e.g., quarterly or annually) to meet standards like PCI-DSS, HIPAA, or ISO 27001.
5. **Continuous Scanning for Critical Assets** – Monitor high-value targets like internet-facing systems and production servers **weekly or even daily** with automated tools to catch emerging threats immediately.
